# Terminal

pushd
# It's like saying, "Save where I am, then go here."
# takes your current directory and "pushes" it into a list for later,
#then it changes to another directory.

pushd, if you run it by itself with no arguments, 
will switch between your current directory and the last one you pushed.

#It's an easy way to switch between two directories.


popd
# takes the last directory you pushed and "pops" it off, taking you back there.
